# The Trailer Stack

![The Trailer Stack]()

```sh
npx create-remix@latest --template zyishai/trailer-stack
```

The Trailer Stack is a **quick and lightweight** Remix stack. The base build weighs only 40kB!  
It uses a combination of very minimal setup and optional add-ons that can be installed and configured during initialization.  
Note that this stack is opinionated to my needs; however, you can very easily remove/replace different parts that you don't need/want.
